metalsmith-filetype-marker
==========================

This provides a simple way to mark files of different types with some piece of front matter.

This helps when using tools that may change your file like the
[metalsmith markdown](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-markdown) plugin. This way the
template can make informed decisions about where a file came from.
